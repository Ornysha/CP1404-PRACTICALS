# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository

This repository contains my practical work for the subject **CP1404 – Programming 2** at **James Cook University**.  
My name is **Ornysha Biswas**, and this repo showcases my progress in learning Python programming, focusing on writing
clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code

- Use **meaningful variable and function names** to make code easy to understand.
- Keep functions **short and focused** — each function should do one thing well.
- Follow consistent **code formatting and indentation** to improve readability.
